title: "db.cloud.configure()"
---
Configure the URL of the database to keep in sync with.

## Syntax

```
npm install dexie-cloud-addon
```

```js
import Dexie from "dexie";
import dexieCloud from "dexie-cloud-addon";

const db = new Dexie("mydb", {addons: [dexieCloud]});

db.version(x).stores({
  ...
});

db.cloud.configure({
  databaseUrl: "<database URL>",
  requireAuth: true | false,
  fetchToken?: customTokenFetcher
});
```

## Remarks

The call to db.cloud.configure() must be done before any requests are put on the `db` (the Dexie instance) so that the database knows what to do when before opening it the first time. See [Sync flow](dexie-cloud-addon#sync-flow).

## Parameters

| Parameter   | Type     | Explanation                                        |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| databaseUrl | string   | The URL to your cloud database                     |
| requireAuth | boolean  | Whether or not to require authentication initially |
| fetchToken  | function | Custom token fetching callback                     |

## requireAuth

If this parameter is true, the system will make sure there it has a valid authentication token before before any call to the database can proceed. In practice, this means that the user will be required to authenticate the very first time app is used on the device. Authentication token will be securely cached for 3 months unless user logs out prior to that. If looking at your progressive web app as if it was a native app, regard the authentication as a part of the installation process. Once installed, the app should continue working as expected without the need of reauthentication. This policy will be configurable in a later version. We will also be looking at ways to separate the authentication policy for read and write - you might always be able to access data, but in order to mutate data you could apply a different policy with requiring reauthentication.

## fetchToken

Implement your own way of retrieving a dexie-cloud token. By default, this token will be generated by Dexie Cloud server by providing email and OTP to it.
But your application may have its own way of authenticating users, or integrate with a 3rd part authentication provider. In that case you will need to implement
your own server-side endpoint on a server that can authenticate your user. That server endpoint (who known your user's identity) can then request a token from Dexie Cloud without requiring the OTP step. This needs to happen server-side because in order to request a token without going through the OTP step will require the REST client to provide your client_id and client_secret in the request. You have client_id and client_secret in the dexie-cloud.key file that was generated when you created the database. These shall never be used from client side. The key file
should not be added to git either but be managed in a secure way using the cloud infrastructure of your own choice.

### Example: Integrate Custom Authentication

To integrate with custom authentication, you can either integrate with your existing web server or create a new server endpoint using a authentication framework of your choice, such as Node.js and Passportjs. You need to make that authentication solution you have get a new API endpoint that requests tokens from Dexie Cloud via server-to-server communication. The new server endpoint should accept requests from your dexie-cloud client (requested from your `fetchToken` callback), then it should request the token using server-to-server communication towards the Dexie Cloud REST API, and then return the resulting token to your client.

**Node.js server endpoint**

The code below examplifies how to generate tokens if your authentication solution is based on Node.js and [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org){:target="_blank"}. If you have another server-side platform or language for your existing authentication, you would need to translate this example to that language and platform. Note that the authentication platform (Passport or other) can use whatever mechanism to authenticate the user - integrate with OpenIDConnect, Google, Github, facebook etc. For guides for doing so, we refer to other guides on the internet
that covers this. If you are starting from a white paper and just need a way to get going, we recommend the guides from [auth0](https://auth0.com){:target="_blank"} or [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org){:target="_blank"}.

```js 
// ...other express / passport imports and setup...

const nodeFetch = require("node-fetch");

const DB_URL = process.env.DEXIE_CLOUD_DB_URL;
const CLIENT_ID = process.env.DEXIE_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID;
const CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.DEXIE_CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET;

// ...other express / passport endpoints here...

// The new endpoint to add:
app.get('/dexie-cloud-token', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Assume you've configured passport to store user on request:
    // See http://www.passportjs.org/docs/configure/
    const {user} = req;

    // Request token from your Dexie Cloud database:
    const tokenResponse = await nodeFetch(`${DB_URL}/token`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        grant_type: "client_credentials",
        client_id: CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
        sub: user.userId, // or user.email.
        email: user.email,
        name: user.name
      });
    });
    if (!tokenResponse.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to retrieve token from Dexie Cloud`);
    }

    // Forward token response to your client:
    const tokenBody = await tokenResponse.json();
    res.set('Cache-Control', 'no-store');
    res.json(tokenBody);
  } catch (error) {
    return next(error);
  }
});
```

**fetchToken implementation in your client code**

Assuming that your server endpoint will respond to the path "/dexie-cloud-token" as examplified above (using whatever server side technology you have for that),
the client code to integrate it will be:

```js
db.cloud.configure({
  databaseUrl: "<database URL>",
  requireAuth: true,
  fetchToken: () => fetch("/dexie-cloud-token").then(res => res.json())
});
```
