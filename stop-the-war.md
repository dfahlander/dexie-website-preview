Hi, I'm David, the author of Dexie.js and I'm from Sweden. I hereby take a stand against Putin's illegal and horrible, unprovoked war under **false flag** against his brother country Ukraine!

Millions of innocent civilians have been tortured, scared to death and have had to flee their country.

**Russia is invading another country.** This is the fact. **And no one has threatened Russia!**

Putin feel threatened though - not by a country - Putin is only **threatened by the truth, the free press and democratic values.** Only Putin and Kreml are threatened, <b><u>not the Russian people</u></b> (except the threats from their own government). Putin is threatened becuase he don't want his people see Ukraine bloom of economic growth, decreased corruption and better lives - an outcome from working against corruption, allowing a free press and establishing a healthy democratic society. Putin don't want his Russian people to see this happening to a neighbour country because the difference from Putin's way of ruling would make his people want to put him out.

Democracy and non-corruption are not 'western values' - they are humanitarian values! No country should regard them as the enemy. But for authoritarian leaders - democracy is enemy! Therefore they lie about "the west" in the most horrendous ways. **The leaders are scared. The people should not be.**

If Ukraine had not been invaded, its democratic and economical growth would be a 'dangerous' example of how a country can bloom. What good would a corrupt leadership like Kreml be then? **Russia could also bloom, get the freedom, democracy and end of its corruption.** That's Putin's horror and the real reason for starting the war - to keep his own power, lying to his people that the west is after them.

But it's not just Putin. We have the war mongers - those who's dream is a greater Russia that takes more land. Anyone having these dreams in the 21th century - PLEASE STOP!

I never believed a war like this could happen in present time. I thought this kind of thinking was over after the 20th century. In order to understand why, I read a lot of Russian news because I want to understand how people can even think that invading another country, killing children, torturing and raping could be something they would accept their goverment doing.

The problem seems to be long time Russian propaganda that have made Russians believe in rediculous lies about Ukranians over a long period of time. Lies about Ukraininans being nazies (despite that neo-nazism is more common in other countries than Ukraine). The lies have been going on over and over, for years using state television brain washing the people. Hitler used the exact same tactics as Putin - to lie about another country, to get people onboard before invading it.

The world is watching this awful war with disgust.

# Open Source is about freedom, democracy and peacefulness

We want to live in a world where people are free. Open source community incarnates that spirit. The spritit of democracy, freedom and peacefulness. The opposite of all this is authoritarianism. An attack on a democratic country under false flag is an attack of all of us who want's to live in a free spirit. This is a battle between good and evil. Between openess and closeness. Between democracy and authoritarianism. Between peace and war.

In the end, freedom, goodness and democracy will win.
